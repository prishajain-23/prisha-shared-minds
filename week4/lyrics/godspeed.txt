I will always love you
How I do
Let go of a prayer for you
Just a sweet word
The table is prepared for you
Wishing you godspeed, glory
There will be mountains you won't move
Still, I'll always be there for you
How I do
I let go of my claim on you, it's a free world
You look down on where you came from sometimes
But you'll have this place to call home, always
This love will keep us through blinding of the eyes (oh)
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind (until it's time)
This love will keep us through blinding of the eyes (oh, oh-oh)
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind (oh, oh-oh, oh)
This love will keep us through blinding of the eyes (oh, until it's time we die)
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind
Hmm-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
I'll always love you until the time we die
Oh-oh, hmm
